# WoopEphemeral
This project was completed in 3 months by 4 programers (it's us !) with Unreal Engine 4. In this game you have to finish the levels as quickly as possible. To do that, you will have some tools at your disposal :

your legs to move, jump and walljump 
//gif ici?

fire your right fist to trigger interuptors or destroy walls !
//pareil?

use a grappling hook and a dash to defy the laws of gravity
//again
